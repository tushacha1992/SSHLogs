SSH session Log Creation and Management
This is simple bash script to capture the ssh sessions created from one linux server to other server. It also gives the entry when session is expired by user.
I searched on net for solution but didn't found the script that will give info about session taken from one linux server to other server. You can get info about the session taken to your Linux server.
Hope this will be helpful:)
